Homework 1 Analysis
Tweet Generator Assumptions:
We bucket the users of twitter into 3 general groups, famous people who tweet a lot and have many followers, normal users who follow their friends and some famous people, and people who created an account solely to follow people and probably dont tweet at all.
We modeled the numbers based on famous people (like the president), normal people (like the two of us), and made assumptions for the small bucket.
As of 1/9/2020 Donald Trump has made 50k tweets, we edited this because this is the beginning of twitter and arrived at a number of 25k tweets for the famous bucket. We also decided that famous people should take up about 3/4s of twitter, since (including retweets) we have found that this is usually the case when we use the app.
For normal people we looked at our accounts and rounded average the number of tweets we made and our following/follower ratio.
For the small bucket we imagined they just follow a few famous accounts for their source of information and maybe they write some tweets but probably not.
